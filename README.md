The free and open map API to create and share web maps based on
[OpenLayers 3](http://openlayers.org).

Watch the online demo at http://apps.meggsimum.de/shareloc/

At the moment there are a few free map layers based on open data included in the
online demo. But it is easily possible to include your own layers (e. g. WMS) in
your Shareloc instance.

### Use by JavaScript API ###

Shareloc offers an easy-to-use JavaScript API to create your own OpenLayers 3
maps. Therefore you just have to include the Shareloc JavaScript lib into your
HTML page. Now with a few lines of code it is possible to create a customized
OpenLayers map.

```javascript
var api = new Shareloc.MapApi();
var params = {
    // lon of map center
    X: 8.318049976895958,
    // lat of map center
    Y: 49.43451657605041,
    // initial map zoom level
    zoom: 14,
    // layer
    bgLayer: "osm.base"
};
// create and return your ol3 map instance
var olMap = api.map(params);

```
Check out the [API docs](http://meggsimum.github.io/shareloc/docs/) to see all
possibilities Shareloc offers.

### Use by web application ###

With Shareloc it is possible to create your OpenLayers 3 web map without any
coding. By a [web application](http://apps.meggsimum.de/shareloc/) you can
configure your map view, add a marker to point at a special place and optionally
add a text in a bubble to your marker. Afterwards you can share your map by a
simple link or embed the map in your own website.
